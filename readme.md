this thing is a fork of the [Cube 2 engine](http://cubeengine.com/), intended as a minimal starting point for learning and experimentation.

all fps elements from [sauerbraten](http://sauerbraten.org) have been removed, leaving just the core engine and a basic game setup.

in short, if you try to run it as-is, youâ€™ll find the interface, the map editor, and CubeScript working.
