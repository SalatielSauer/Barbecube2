this thing is a fork of [Cube Engine 2](http://cubeengine.com/), meant to be a starting point for learning purposes.

all fps elements ([sauerbraten](http://sauerbraten.org)) have been removed, leaving just the engine and a basic game setup.

in short, if you try to run it as-is, youâ€™ll find the interface, the map editor, and CubeScript working.
